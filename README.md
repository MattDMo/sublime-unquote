## Unquote for Sublime Text

A super simple package for quickly removing quotes and backticks from around a selected string. It also works with triple-quoted Python docstrings and triple-backtick Markdown code fences. The quotes can either be inside the selection or immediately surrounding it.

### Use

Highlight quoted text and hit default keybinding of `command-'` (`win-'` on Windows).

The [***Expand Selection to Quotes***](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Expand%20Selection%20to%20Quotes) package complements this one very well.
